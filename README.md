# Lambdalith Router

This is a minimal, platform-agnostic routing library, made for use
with Lambdaliths. This package does not and will not support
authentication or user session management tooling. It is a minimal
routing layer to use with Lambdaliths in a cloud-native compute
setup. The TypeScript interfaces are fully platform-agnostic and can
be used with the compute platforms of all major cloud providers.

The tenets of this package are high speeds and minimal bundle sizes,
while being able to work seamlessly in a cloud-native environment.
There is no aim for maximal functionality, especially where there are
other patterns to deal with the concerns in the cloud. Authentication
tooling will remain out of scope, as this is expected to be handled
by other moving parts of the cloud infrastructure.
